# Incident Simulation: Web Application Attack

## Overview
This project simulates a security incident involving a web application targeted by an internal attacker.  
The objective is to analyze the attack from a SOC perspective by identifying suspicious activity, reconstructing the timeline, and documenting indicators of compromise.

## Scenario
A simulated internal web application was targeted by an attacker performing credential abuse and unauthorized access attempts.  
Security events were generated and later analyzed to determine the nature and impact of the activity.

## Objectives
- Simulate realistic attack activity
- Identify suspicious authentication and web requests
- Analyze logs to reconstruct the incident timeline
- Document findings in a SOC-style incident report
- Propose remediation and detection improvements

## Deliverables
- Incident Report
- Technical Appendix
- Screenshots of key findings
- Relevant log excerpts

## Outcome
The analysis demonstrates the ability to detect and investigate web-based security incidents using structured SOC methodologies.
