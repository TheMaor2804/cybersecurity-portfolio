# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity projects demonstrating practical skills aligned with a Junior SOC / Security Analyst role.  
The projects focus on incident detection, analysis, and response, with controlled attack simulations used to generate realistic security events.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Security incident analysis and reporting
- Log analysis (authentication, web server, system events)
- Identification of indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Understanding of common web application attacks
- Documentation and communication of security findings

## Tools & Technologies
- Kali Linux
- OWASP Juice Shop (simulated target)
- Web server logs
- Windows / Linux system logs
- Burp Suite
- Manual log analysis (SOC-style)

## Projects
- **Incident-Simulation-Web-Attack**  
  Simulated a web application attack and analyzed the resulting security events from a SOC perspective, including timeline reconstruction and remediation recommendations.
